# Fuzzy System Project

## Overview

This project implements a fuzzy logic system to model and simulate decision-making in a tipping scenario. Fuzzy logic allows for handling uncertainty and imprecision in the decision-making process, making it suitable for real-world scenarios where precise inputs and outputs are challenging to define.

## Features

- **Fuzzy Class:** Contains implementation for common fuzzy membership functions (e.g., Gaussian, triangular, trapezoidal).
- **Control Class:** Implements a fuzzy control system with antecedents, consequents, rules, and methods for rule evaluation and aggregation.
- **Example Tipping System:** Demonstrates the usage of the fuzzy classes to model a tipping system with service and food as input variables and tip as the output variable.

## Dependencies
